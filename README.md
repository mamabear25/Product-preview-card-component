## My process
I started by giving the page a structure with html, styled it using an external style sheet and created a link within the head section of the webpage where it can be accessed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS media queries

### What I learned

I Learned how to create optimal layout depending on a user's device's screen size using css media queries.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward to getting more indepth with other frontend frameworks.
